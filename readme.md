# Simple shopping cart with react & stripe
The frontend client side was created using vite, which spins the initial template project much faster than create-react-app.
A backend express server is setup with the stripe configuration to enable payments.
Once a purchase order is made, stripe facilitates a url that redirects the user to a predefined payment form.
